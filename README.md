v 1.0.0

This Chrome extension applies minor CSS style changes to fix an issue on Insightly's reporting page, where viewing a large number of columns is not user-friendly.



## Installation Instructions

1. Download the code from this GitHub repository by clicking on the "Code" button in the upper right and "Download Zip"
1. Unzip the folder.
1. In Chrome, [manage your extensions](chrome://extensions/).
1. Enable developer mode in the top right.
1. Click the "Load Unpacked" button and upload the entire  unzipped folder and its contents.
1. Make sure the extension is enabled, and then navigate to the Insightly reports page.
1. Hooray! ðŸŽ‰ You should now be able to use the Insightly reports page with more columns.
    
## Planned Updates

- Add an icon
- Change CSS.  The current styles only make the report view usable with a large number of columns.  They do not completely fix the layout, as the navbar on the side of the screen overlaps the report when scrolling to the right.
- Add a pop-up to the extension to toggle style changes, edit the route on which the extension works, apply custom CSS, and save choices in local storage
- Upload to the Chrome Web Store
